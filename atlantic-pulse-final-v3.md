# Atlantic Pulse

## The U.S. Political Idea Competition Forecast — and Its Implications for the Transatlantic

---

## Summary

Atlantic Pulse monitors the competition of political ideas inside the United States and forecasts which ideas will shape policy outcomes — with direct implications for Europe and the transatlantic alliance.

We observe the U.S. domestic perspective, extract the internal conflict lines of political ideas as they are negotiated in elections and policy debates, and forecast which narratives will dominate.

Four outputs. Each with current data and a 3-month forecast. Best case, worst case, realistic case.

---

## Why Do Narratives Determine Political Outcomes?

Ideas do not win because they are correct. Ideas win because their narratives create resonance.

The same idea can succeed or fail depending on which narrative carries it. Different groups frame the same idea differently. The narrative that creates the most resonance determines whether the idea becomes politically feasible.

### Why This Matters

Traditional analysis tracks positions: Who supports X? Who opposes X?

Narrative analysis tracks something deeper: WHY do they support it? Which emotional frame carries the idea? And which frame is winning?

The "why" determines staying power. The "why" predicts policy. The "why" is what Atlantic Pulse measures — and forecasts.

---

## How Does the Same Idea Become Four Different Narratives?

**The Idea (Statement of Position):**
> "The USA should reduce its NATO financial commitment."

This idea exists across the political spectrum. But it is carried by completely different narratives.

### Four Narratives for One Idea

**Republicans in Georgia — "America Rising"**

"We don't need Europe. We're stronger alone. Let them pay for their own defense. America First means we stop subsidizing countries that lecture us."

Dominant emotion: Pride, strength, independence.

**Democrats in Georgia — "Responsible Priorities"**

"We have crumbling bridges and underfunded schools. Before we send billions overseas, we need to invest here. Our allies can handle more."

Dominant emotion: Pragmatism, domestic focus.

**Republicans in California — "Smart Investment"**

"NATO is a Cold War relic with poor ROI. Our capital should flow to Pacific defense and tech superiority. Europe is declining. Asia is the future."

Dominant emotion: Efficiency, strategic calculation.

**Democrats in California — "Anti-Militarism"**

"We spend too much on military everywhere. NATO is part of a global war machine. Cut defense, fund healthcare and climate."

Dominant emotion: Social justice, anti-war sentiment.

### What Atlantic Pulse Measures

All four groups support the same idea. But for completely different reasons. Atlantic Pulse measures which narrative has the most resonance — and forecasts where it's heading.

### The Implication for Europe

The idea "Reduce NATO commitment" is gaining traction — but NOT because Americans want to save money for schools.

It wins because the "America Rising" narrative has resonance: pride, independence, rejection.

This changes everything:
- Appeals to shared values will not work
- Appeals to efficiency will not work
- The motivation is identity, not budget

Understanding the dominant narrative tells you not just WHAT is coming, but HOW to respond.

## What Political Ideas Will Atlantic Pulse Track in 2026?

| Event | Key Ideas in Competition | Transatlantic Implication |
|-------|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Midterms** | Governing legitimacy, institutional trust | Direction of US policy 2027-2028 |
| **NATO Summit** | Burden sharing, Article 5, European autonomy | Alliance cohesion or fragmentation |
| **G7** | US leadership vs. multipolar coordination | Economic policy alignment |
| **Ukraine** | Support vs. settlement vs. disengagement | European security architecture |
| **Greenland** | Territorial expansion, Arctic strategy | US-Europe friction point |
| **Immigration** | Border security, deportation | Domestic pressure |
| **Iran** | Diplomacy vs. containment vs. military | Middle East stability |
| **China** | Decoupling, tech restrictions, Taiwan | Trade, supply chains |
| **Venezuela** | Monroe Doctrine, regional hegemony | Latin America direction |

## The Four Outputs of Atlantic Pulse

Each output includes current measurement AND a 3-month forecast with three scenarios.

---

### Output 1: Idea Competition Ranking

Which political ideas have momentum? Ranked by resonance.

```
TOP 5 IDEAS — March 2026

1. "NATO Burden Sharing"     ▲ +15%  [Strong momentum]
2. "Ukraine Fatigue"         ▲ +12%  [Rising fast]
3. "America First 2.0"       ▲ +8%   [Building]
4. "China Decoupling"        ● +2%   [Stable]
5. "Alliance Strength"       ▼ -7%   [Losing ground]
```

**3-MONTH FORECAST → June 2026**

| Scenario | Projection |
|----------|------------|
| **REALISTIC** | "NATO Burden" stays #1. "Ukraine Fatigue" rises to #2. "Alliance Strength" continues decline. |
| **BEST CASE** | "Alliance Strength" recovers to Top 3 after positive NATO Summit signals. |
| **WORST CASE** | "America First 2.0" overtakes all. "Alliance Strength" exits Top 10. Isolationist frame dominant. |

**What this tells you:** Which ideas require attention. Where scenario planning should focus. How the landscape is shifting.

---

### Output 2: Narrative Resonance Score

For top ideas: which narrative is winning? Why is the idea gaining traction?

**Example: "USA should reduce NATO commitment"**

```
CURRENT RESONANCE — March 2026

"America Rising"          ████████████░░░░  62%  ← DOMINANT
"Responsible Priorities"  ██████░░░░░░░░░░  28%
"Smart Investment"        ████░░░░░░░░░░░░  18%
"Anti-Militarism"         ███░░░░░░░░░░░░░  14%
```

**3-MONTH FORECAST → June 2026**

| Scenario | Projection |
|----------|------------|
| **REALISTIC** | "America Rising" consolidates at 65-70%. Emotional rejection frame strengthens. |
| **BEST CASE** | "Responsible Priorities" grows to 35%. Pragmatic frame opens negotiation space. |
| **WORST CASE** | "America Rising" reaches 75%+. Identity-based rejection becomes dominant. Rational arguments ineffective. |

**Implication:** Best case allows for transactional negotiation. Worst case means appeals to partnership will fail — only pressure or incentives work.

---

### Output 3: Europe Framing Index

How is Europe framed in US discourse? This determines what policies toward Europe become feasible.

```
EUROPE FRAMING — March 2026

"Freeloader / Burden"     ████████████░░░░  58%  ← DOMINANT
"Irrelevant / Declining"  ██████░░░░░░░░░░  22%
"Partner / Ally"          ████░░░░░░░░░░░░  14%
"Competitor / Rival"      ██░░░░░░░░░░░░░░   6%
```

**3-MONTH FORECAST → June 2026**

| Scenario | Projection |
|----------|------------|
| **REALISTIC** | "Freeloader" stays dominant (55-60%). "Partner" stable at 12-16%. Pressure on defense spending continues. |
| **BEST CASE** | "Partner" rises to 25% after NATO Summit. Window for positive repositioning opens. Cooperation narratives gain traction. |
| **WORST CASE** | "Freeloader" + "Irrelevant" combined reach 85%. Europe becomes political punching bag. Coordination extremely costly. |

**Implication for Europe:**

| Scenario | What it means |
|----------|---------------|
| Realistic | Expect continued pressure. Prepare defensive positioning. |
| Best Case | Active opportunity to reshape perception. Investment in visibility. |
| Worst Case | Transatlantic coordination becomes very expensive. Prepare for friction. |

---

### Output 4: Narrative Velocity

How fast is a narrative moving? When will it reach critical mass? How much time to position?

```
VELOCITY REPORT: "Ukraine Fatigue" — March 2026

CURRENT:
Speed:      +340% resonance growth in 60 days
Direction:  Elite discourse → Mainstream media → Public
Position:   Crossing into mainstream NOW
```

**3-MONTH FORECAST → June 2026**

| Scenario | Projection |
|----------|------------|
| **REALISTIC** | Dominant frame by May. Policy pressure visible by June. Congressional funding debates affected. |
| **BEST CASE** | Velocity slows in April. Stabilizes at 40% resonance. Counter-narratives gain traction. |
| **WORST CASE** | Acceleration continues. Reaches 70%+ by NATO Summit. "End the war" becomes majority position. |

**Window:** 6-8 weeks to position before frame hardens.

**Trigger to watch:** Next congressional funding debate. Presidential statements on Ukraine.

## The Measurement System

Atlantic Pulse uses 461 metrics across 25 analysis families. Each metric can have 101 possible states.

Total measurement space: 10^924 possible combinations.

For comparison: all atoms in the observable universe equal approximately 10^80.

Statistical methods identify significant patterns within this complexity. The forecasts are based on trend extrapolation, historical pattern matching, and trigger-condition modeling.

The output is reproducible and testable — not opinion.

---

## Pilot Proposal

### 4-Week Pilot

Deliverables:

- 1 full monthly report (all 4 outputs with forecasts)
- Up to 2 alerts (if thresholds trigger)
- 1 review call (30 minutes): what proved useful, what to adjust

### Evaluation Criteria

Does the report provide:

- Earlier signal than standard monitoring?
- Actionable forecasts (not just current state)?
- Usable input for scenario planning?

### Stop/Continue Rule

If the pilot does not create clear decision value, it ends. No commitment beyond pilot.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What exactly does Atlantic Pulse measure and forecast?

Four things, each with 3-month forecasts:
1. Which ideas have momentum (Idea Competition Ranking)
2. Which narrative carries each idea (Narrative Resonance Score)
3. How Europe is framed in US discourse (Europe Framing Index)
4. How fast narratives are moving (Velocity)

### Why three scenarios per forecast?

Because the future is not deterministic. Best/Worst/Realistic gives you:
- A planning baseline (Realistic)
- An opportunity window (Best Case)
- A risk scenario (Worst Case)

### Why focus on US domestic discourse?

Because US foreign policy is shaped by domestic political competition. The transatlantic relationship is negotiated internally before it is negotiated externally. Understanding which domestic narratives win tells you what external policies become feasible.

### How is this different from polling?

Polls measure stated positions. Atlantic Pulse measures the narratives behind positions — and forecasts where they're heading. Positions shift fast. Narratives shift slowly and predictably.

### Can tracking be customized?

Yes. Additional ideas, specific thresholds, regional focus — all adjustable to GIS priorities.
