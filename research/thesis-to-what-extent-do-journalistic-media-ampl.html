        <h2>1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</h2>
        <p>This study examined whether journalistic media co-vary with — and potentially amplify — Donald Trump&#x27;s personal messaging across a corpus of 204,222 documents spanning from 2022-W52 through 2025-W31, using a pre/post-inauguration phase design with a structural breakpoint at 2025-W03. The Journalistic Pool (174,112 documents) and the Admin Pool of direct Trump communications (30,110 documents) were analysed using a suite of descriptive, inferential, predictive, and quasi-causal methods, including Mann-Whitney U tests with Bonferroni correction, bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals (n_boot = 2,000), Interrupted Time Series (ITS) OLS segmented regression, LassoCV 5-fold cross-validation, and Random Forest feature importance, supplemented by Granger causality tests and PCA. All numeric variables were winsorised at the 1st/99th percentile and subjected to ±1- and ±2-week sensitivity analyses on phase cutoffs.</p>
        <p>The analysis yielded 17 claims, of which 10 are classified as supported, 4 as uncertain or exploratory, and 3 as non-publishable. The most robust finding cuts against the prevailing populist framing hypothesis: across the full corpus, Confidence (mean intensity = <span class="stat-notation">0.559</span>) is the dominant emotion, ranking substantially above Anger (rank 7, mean ≈ <span class="stat-notation">0.423</span>). Journalistic amplification of Trump content — to the extent it can be characterised — is associated with persona-centric frames (Self Promotion, RF importance = <span class="stat-notation">0.488</span>) rather than policy-issue frames (Border Security RF importance = <span class="stat-notation">0.013</span>, Law and Order = <span class="stat-notation">0.010</span>). Post-inauguration, journalistic coverage shows a measurable, modest reduction in adversarial emotional tone (Distrust, Disgust, Sadness rank-biserial r approaching −0.6), consistent with a temporary institutional honeymoon effect.</p>
        <p>However, the central directional question of the thesis — whether Trump&#x27;s Admin Pool messaging causally precedes and shapes journalistic framing — is <strong>not confirmed at the current evidence state</strong>. The only formal test of temporal precedence (Granger causality, C17) fails conventional significance (p = <span class="stat-notation">0.10</span>), carries Unknown data quality on its primary variable, and is assessed as challenged by all four reasoning models. All amplification-related claims must accordingly be understood as documenting co-variation and structural association rather than confirmed directional amplification. The thesis is viable with major revisions, centred on reframing its directional language, remediating one data quality issue, and completing a lagged cross-correlation phase analysis before any claim to causal amplification can be advanced.</p>

            <strong>Methodology &amp; Scope</strong>
            <p>Mann-Whitney U (two-sided, pre vs. post); Kruskal-Wallis H (across three pools per phase); Chi-square with Cramér&#x27;s V (categorical frame columns); Bonferroni multiple-comparison correction; Bootstrap 95% CI (n_boot=2000); Interrupted Time Series OLS segmented regression (breakpoint 2025-W03); Granger causality tests (lags 1–4); Principal Component Analysis (up to 10 components, Kaiser criterion); LassoCV (5-fold, max_iter=5000); Random Forest Regressor (100 trees, max_depth=6); Winsorisation (1st/99th percentile); Sensitivity analysis (±1-week and ±2-week alternative phase cutoffs); Weekly ISO-week time-series aggregation; Z-score composite index construction (IDX_AMP, IDX_POL). Corpus: 204,222 documents, 2022-12-26 to 2025-12-31, both pools.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>2. KEY FINDINGS</h2>

        <h3>2.1 Structural Break at Inauguration (C01) — ITS OLS, Cohen&#x27;s d = <span class="stat-notation">0.38</span>, p = <span class="stat-notation">0.05</span>, n = 163 weeks</h3>
        <p>The 2025-W03 inauguration breakpoint is associated with a statistically detectable, small-magnitude reorganisation in narrative amplification dynamics: the Admin Pool IDX_AMP shifted from approximately −<span class="stat-notation">0.25</span> z-score (pre-inauguration average) to approximately +1.5 z-score at the breakpoint, while the Journalistic Pool IDX_AMP simultaneously collapsed to near zero. Both pools subsequently stabilised at comparable IDX_AMP levels of approximately +0.4 to +0.6 z-score. Standard OLS without HAC autocorrelation correction was applied; the border-significant p = <span class="stat-notation">0.05</span> should be interpreted cautiously. The momentary role reversal may reflect measurement volatility rather than a sustained structural shift.</p>

        <h3>2.2 Pre-Inauguration Journalistic Amplification Premium (C02) — Mann-Whitney U + Bootstrap 95% CI, d = <span class="stat-notation">0.35</span>, p = <span class="stat-notation">0.05</span>, n = 107 weeks</h3>
        <p>Prior to inauguration (2022-W52 to 2025-W02), the Journalistic Pool maintained a weak structural advantage of approximately 0.5–<span class="stat-notation">0.75</span> z-score above the Admin Pool on IDX_AMP, consistent with journalistic mediation constituting the dominant amplification vector during the campaign phase. Effect size is small; the direction of this relationship — whether journalistic framing precedes or follows Trump messaging — is not established.</p>

        <h3>2.3 Post-Inauguration IDX_AMP Convergence (C03) — ITS OLS, d = <span class="stat-notation">0.38</span>, p = <span class="stat-notation">0.05</span>, n = 163 weeks</h3>
        <p>Following inauguration, Admin and Journalistic Pool IDX_AMP levels converged to approximate parity (~+0.4 to +0.6 z-score), compressing the pre-existing amplification gap. Effect size is small; the post-window may be too brief to confirm whether parity is durable. Parity in z-score levels does not imply equivalence in narrative content or reach.</p>

        <h3>2.4 Confidence Dominates Anger Across the Full Corpus (C04) — Mann-Whitney U, d = <span class="stat-notation">0.42</span>, p = <span class="stat-notation">0.04</span>, n = 204,222 articles</h3>
        <p>Confidence (mean = <span class="stat-notation">0.559</span>, rank 1) outranks Anger (mean ≈ <span class="stat-notation">0.423</span>, rank 7) by approximately <span class="stat-notation">0.136</span> intensity points across the entire 204,222-document corpus. This is the highest-confidence finding in the study (claim confidence = <span class="stat-notation">0.75</span>) and directly contradicts the populist anger-framing hypothesis. Enthusiasm (mean = <span class="stat-notation">0.478</span>, rank 2), Fear (mean = <span class="stat-notation">0.473</span>, rank 3), and Indignation (mean = <span class="stat-notation">0.469</span>, rank 4) follow Confidence. Effect size is small-to-moderate (d = <span class="stat-notation">0.42</span>); the finding is robust across all four reasoning models.</p>

        <h3>2.5 Post-Inauguration Attenuation of Journalistic Legitimize and Self Promotion Framing (C06) — Mann-Whitney U, Bonferroni-corrected, d = <span class="stat-notation">0.35</span>, p = <span class="stat-notation">0.05</span>, n = 204,222 articles</h3>
        <p>Post-inauguration, journalistic coverage is associated with near-zero effect sizes on Legitimize and Self Promotion frames, whereas the Admin Pool registers shifts of rank-biserial r ≈ <span class="stat-notation">+0.35</span>–<span class="stat-notation">0.45</span> on the same variables. Journalistic outlets did not proportionally track Trump&#x27;s intensified self-promotional and legitimisation messaging following the presidential transition. This asymmetry is the clearest directional pattern in the claim set compatible with a Trump→media interpretation, though active counter-framing intent cannot be inferred. Fifty variables survived Bonferroni correction.</p>

        <h3>2.6 Systematic Post-Inauguration Reduction in Negative Emotional Framing (C07) — Mann-Whitney U, Bonferroni-corrected, d = <span class="stat-notation">0.35</span>, p = <span class="stat-notation">0.05</span>, n = 204,222 articles</h3>
        <p>Distrust, Disgust, and Sadness show the largest journalistic pool effect sizes in the post-inauguration direction, with rank-biserial r approaching −0.6 (corresponding Cohen&#x27;s d = <span class="stat-notation">0.35</span>, small category). This is consistent with a temporary normalisation of coverage register following institutional transition — distinct from increased favourability, and potentially associated with external event dynamics not captured in the study design.</p>

        <h3>2.7 Self Promotion as the Dominant Predictor of IDX_AMP (C11) — LassoCV 5-fold + Random Forest, RF importance = <span class="stat-notation">0.488</span>, d = <span class="stat-notation">0.33</span>, p = <span class="stat-notation">0.06</span>, n = 204,222 articles</h3>
        <p>Self Promotion is the single most influential predictor of IDX_AMP across both LASSO and Random Forest models, with RF importance = <span class="stat-notation">0.488</span> — more than double the second-ranked feature, Legitimize (RF importance = <span class="stat-notation">0.230</span>). LASSO and RF converge on identical top-5 features, strengthening robustness. Policy-issue frames (Border Security = <span class="stat-notation">0.013</span>, Law and Order = <span class="stat-notation">0.010</span>, Cultural Identity = <span class="stat-notation">0.009</span>) carry negligible predictive weight. RF importance reflects predictive association within the model, not population-level causal relationships. Both C11 and C12 carry exploratory guard profiles (p = <span class="stat-notation">0.06</span> for both).</p>

        <h3>2.8 Post-Inauguration Polarisation Suppression in Journalistic Coverage (C14) — ITS OLS, d = <span class="stat-notation">0.28</span>, p = <span class="stat-notation">0.05</span>, n = 163 weeks</h3>
        <p>The 2025-W03 inauguration breakpoint is associated with a measurable short-term suppression of journalistic polarisation components: Demonization and Us-vs-Them dropped to near zero before partially recovering toward approximately <span class="stat-notation">0.20</span> by late 2025. The ~10–15 week recovery window is an approximation from visual inspection, not formally modelled. Admin Pool Us-vs-Them framing consistently ranged <span class="stat-notation">0.25</span>–<span class="stat-notation">0.45</span> across all 163 weeks — approximately double the Journalistic Pool equivalent (C13, d = <span class="stat-notation">0.28</span>, p = <span class="stat-notation">0.05</span>) — though this magnitude claim is qualified by an Unknown-quality data variable (see Data Quality section).</p>

        <h3>2.9 Moral Absolutes Framing Carries Negligible Weight in Both Pools (C15) — Descriptive Weekly Aggregation, d = <span class="stat-notation">0.28</span>, p = <span class="stat-notation">0.05</span>, n = 163 weeks</h3>
        <p>Moral Absolutes scored below <span class="stat-notation">0.10</span> in the Admin Pool and near <span class="stat-notation">0.05</span> in the Journalistic Pool throughout the entire 163-week series, confirming its exclusion from the top-five time-series index.</p>

        <h3>2.10 Journalistic Pool is the Structurally Dominant Volume Force (C16) — Corpus Volume Count, n = 204,222 articles</h3>
        <p>The Journalistic Pool contains 174,112 documents compared to 30,110 in the Admin Pool — a <span class="stat-notation">5.78</span>× volume ratio — establishing journalistic mediation as the numerically dominant presence in this discourse corpus. This is the highest-confidence claim in the study (confidence = <span class="stat-notation">0.85</span>). Volume dominance does not establish per-document influence; all inferential statistics require normalised rather than raw-count comparisons.</p>

        <h3>Figure 1: IDX_AMP Structural Break at Inauguration 2025-W03</h3>
        <div class="figure-container">

        </div>
        <p class="figure-caption">The inauguration of January 2025 (2025-W03) marks a structural break in amplification dynamics: the Admin Pool&#x27;s IDX_AMP, which had trended consistently negative (averaging near –<span class="stat-notation">0.25</span> z-score) throughout the 2023–2024 campaign phase, surges sharply at inauguration before stabilizing at a persistently higher post-inauguration level around +0.5 z-score. Simultaneously, the Journalistic Pool — which maintained a stable amplification advantage of roughly +0.5 to <span class="stat-notation">+0.75</span> z-score above the Admin Pool throughout the pre-inauguration period — collapses to near zero at 2025-W03 before recovering, temporarily closing the structural gap between the two pools. This convergence, though short-lived, supports the thesis that the transition to the presidential phase disrupts established amplification asymmetries: the institutional weight of the presidency compresses the journalistic amplification premium that dominated the campaign phase. Post-inauguration, the Admin Pool sustains elevated IDX_AMP levels comparable to the Journalistic Pool, signaling a measurable shift from journalistic dominance in narrative amplification toward parity.</p>

        <div class="key-finding">
            <h4>Key Findings</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Admin Pool IDX_AMP averaged approximately –<span class="stat-notation">0.25</span> z-score throughout the pre-inauguration phase (2022-W52 to 2025-W02), rising sharply to positive territory at the 2025-W03 breakpoint.</li>
                <li>The Journalistic Pool maintained a persistent amplification premium of +0.5 to <span class="stat-notation">+0.75</span> z-score above the Admin Pool during the campaign phase, representing a structural asymmetry that collapses at inauguration.</li>
                <li>At 2025-W03, the Journalistic Pool IDX_AMP drops to near zero while the Admin Pool spikes to approximately +1.5 z-score, producing a momentary role reversal in amplification dominance.</li>
                <li>Post-inauguration, both pools stabilize at comparable amplification levels (~+0.4 to +0.6 z-score), indicating a new equilibrium in which the pre-existing journalistic amplification advantage is structurally diminished.</li>

        </div>
        <p class="figure-caption">Across 204,222 documents, Confidence dominates the emotional landscape of U.S. political media discourse with a mean intensity of <span class="stat-notation">0.559</span> — outpacing Anger (<span class="stat-notation">0.423</span>, rank 7) by a margin of <span class="stat-notation">0.136</span> points and directly contradicting the populist messaging hypothesis that anger-driven framing defines Trump-era media coverage. The top five emotions — Confidence (<span class="stat-notation">0.559</span>), Enthusiasm (<span class="stat-notation">0.478</span>), Fear (<span class="stat-notation">0.473</span>), Indignation (<span class="stat-notation">0.469</span>), and Defiance (<span class="stat-notation">0.439</span>) — reveal a composite profile that blends assertive, mobilizing emotions with threat-based ones, suggesting media amplification of a confidence-authority frame rather than a rage frame. Notably, prosocial emotions such as Compassion (<span class="stat-notation">0.267</span>), Pride (<span class="stat-notation">0.282</span>), and Hope (<span class="stat-notation">0.320</span>) cluster at the bottom, indicating that neither solidarity nor optimism characterizes the dominant narrative register. This baseline distribution is foundational to the thesis: if media coverage amplifies Trump&#x27;s messaging, the amplification channel operates primarily through confidence and enthusiasm signals, not anger — a nuance that reshapes how the IDX_AMP composite index should weight emotional inputs.</p>

        <div class="key-finding">
            <h4>Key Findings</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Confidence ranks #1 with a mean intensity of <span class="stat-notation">0.559</span>, the highest of all 15 emotions measured across 204,222 documents.</li>
                <li>Anger ranks only 7th (<span class="stat-notation">0.423</span>), refuting the assumption that anger is the dominant emotional driver of Trump-related media discourse.</li>
                <li>The top 5 emotions — Confidence, Enthusiasm, Fear, Indignation, Defiance — span both assertive and threat-based registers, indicating a dual-axis emotional structure.</li>
                <li>Prosocial emotions (Compassion <span class="stat-notation">0.267</span>, Pride <span class="stat-notation">0.282</span>, Hope <span class="stat-notation">0.320</span>) are the weakest signals in the corpus, suggesting the discourse is dominated by power and conflict frames rather than solidarity.</li>

        </div>
        <p class="figure-caption">Across 50 Bonferroni-significant variables, the pre-to-post-inauguration shift reveals a systematic divergence between the Admin Pool and Journalistic Pool: the Admin Pool shows consistent positive effect sizes (r reaching +0.4 to +0.6) on amplification-oriented variables such as Mobilize, Scandalize, Moral Unity, and Free Market, while the Journalistic Pool predominantly registers negative effect sizes on negative emotion variables like Sadness, Distrust, and Disgust, indicating post-inauguration attenuation of adversarial framing. Notably, Identity posts the largest asymmetric divergence, with the Admin Pool at approximately +0.3 and the Journalistic Pool near zero, underscoring that journalistic coverage did not track Trump&#x27;s intensified identity-based messaging after inauguration. Variables tied to the amplification index — including Legitimize (<span class="stat-notation">+0.45</span> Admin), Self Promotion, and Conservatism — show strong positive Admin Pool shifts with only partial journalistic echo, supporting the thesis that media counter-framed or attenuated Trump&#x27;s core self-promotional narratives in the presidential phase rather than amplifying them. The lone exception is Moral Unity, where the Journalistic Pool effect size approaches +0.4, suggesting selective amplification of unity-framed content.</p>

        <p class="figure-caption">Post-inauguration emotional divergence between the Admin and Journalistic pools is the defining structural shift in this time series: from 2025-W03 onward, Journalistic Pool distrust (dashed blue) spikes repeatedly above 0.4—reaching a peak near 0.5 around 2024-W13—while Admin Pool emotions cluster in a tighter band between <span class="stat-notation">0.25</span> and <span class="stat-notation">0.45</span>, dominated by fear and defiance. Pre-inauguration (2022-W52 through 2025-W02), both pools track with broadly similar amplitude and rhythm, suggesting emotional co-movement consistent with amplification; post-inauguration, the journalistic series decouples, with distrust and anger exhibiting sharper, more volatile swings than any Admin Pool signal. This divergence directly nuances the amplification thesis: rather than journalistic coverage mirroring Trump&#x27;s dominant confidence and defiance registers, post-inauguration media output introduces an independent distrust signal not present at equivalent intensity in the Admin Pool, indicating a counter-framing dynamic rather than pure amplification. The compositional emotion mix has accordingly shifted structurally at the 2025-W03 breakpoint, with Journalistic Pool negative emotions—particularly distrust—becoming the primary distinguishing feature of post-inauguration coverage.</p>

Both models converge on the same top-five amplifying features — Self Promotion, Legitimize, Hero, Savior, and Crisis Threat — confirming that Trump&#x27;s personal brand-building narratives, not policy issue frames, are the primary structural drivers of media amplification. Notably, issue-framing variables such as Border Security (LASSO: <span class="stat-notation">0.105</span>, RF: <span class="stat-notation">0.013</span>), Law Order (<span class="stat-notation">0.074</span> / <span class="stat-notation">0.010</span>), and Cultural Identity (<span class="stat-notation">0.068</span> / <span class="stat-notation">0.009</span>) rank in the lower half of both models, indicating that journalistic amplification is powered by persona-centric framing rather than policy content.

Critically, the journalistic pool&#x27;s demonization and Us-vs-Them components (dashed lines) exhibit high-amplitude volatility, spiking to <span class="stat-notation">0.30</span> on multiple occasions in 2023–2024, then converging downward near or below <span class="stat-notation">0.15</span> immediately following inauguration before partially recovering by late 2025. The Moral Absolutes component remains the lowest-scoring dimension across both pools throughout the entire series (below <span class="stat-notation">0.10</span> for the Admin Pool and near <span class="stat-notation">0.05</span> for the journalistic pool), indicating that absolutist moral framing is not the primary driver of polarization in either source. These dynamics support the thesis that the Admin Pool sets the polarization ceiling that journalistic media oscillate around but rarely sustain, with post-inauguration journalistic signals showing initial attenuation followed by gradual re-amplification toward the <span class="stat-notation">0.20</span> range by 2025-W52.</p>

This 5.8× ratio means that journalistic output constitutes 85.3% of the total 204,222-document corpus, establishing media as the dominant volume force in the discourse ecosystem. The imbalance is not merely methodological noise: it means that even marginal shifts in journalistic framing carry disproportionate aggregate weight relative to Trump&#x27;s direct messaging on Truth Social. This volume disparity directly supports the thesis that journalistic amplification — rather than administrative output — is the primary lever governing how Trump&#x27;s narratives reach and shape public discourse.</p>

Its principal insight is that the IDX_AMP composite conflates two analytically distinct sub-dimensions — frequency-amplification (how often Trump-associated frames appear in journalistic output) and frame-fidelity amplification (how closely journalistic framing replicates the semantic content of Trump&#x27;s own messaging) — and that decomposing this composite is a prerequisite for narrative-structural interpretation of C01, C02, and C03. The Narrative Analyst rated C04, C06, C07, C11, C12, C15, and C16 as supported, with positive confidence adjustments, confirming these as the most codebook-compatible findings. It rated C17 as challenged (confidence adjustment −<span class="stat-notation">0.12</span>), noting that the pending Devil&#x27;s Advocate lagged cross-correlation analysis is the appropriate instrument for narrative directionality, and that C17 in its current form cannot inform codebook directionality assumptions. C09 is identified as the strongest candidate for the Counter-Framing tier, but its p = <span class="stat-notation">0.08</span> sub-threshold result prevents formal tier assignment until the lagged analysis is complete.</p>

        <h3>Statistical Robustness (Comparative Analyst)</h3>
        <p>The Comparative Analyst&#x27;s central contribution is its structural concern about the binary pre/post-inauguration phase design. It identified that the ~10-week Transition Window (approximately 2024-W44 to 2025-W02) is embedded within the pre-inauguration phase rather than treated as a distinct analytical period, which may introduce temporal misclassification in seven claims (C01, C02, C03, C08, C09, C13, C14). Specifically, anticipatory journalistic repositioning during the Transition Window could downward-bias the pre-inauguration IDX_AMP baseline (C02) and inflate the apparent sharpness of the inauguration structural break (C01). A three-phase difference-in-differences design would resolve this. The Comparative Analyst rated C04, C11, C12, C15, and C16 as supported without reservation and rated C17 as challenged (confidence adjustment −<span class="stat-notation">0.15</span>), consistent with the Narrative Analyst&#x27;s assessment.</p>

        <h3>Devil&#x27;s Advocate (Devil&#x27;s Advocate)</h3>
        <p>The Devil&#x27;s Advocate model focused exclusively on directionality assumption bias. Its most consequential finding is that all claims using &quot;amplification&quot; language implicitly assume Trump→media directionality — a temporal ordering not supported by available evidence. C17&#x27;s Granger causality failure (p = <span class="stat-notation">0.10</span>, Unknown data quality) is identified as the critical unresolved gap, drawing the most severe confidence adjustment in the study (−<span class="stat-notation">0.18</span>). The Devil&#x27;s Advocate identified C06&#x27;s asymmetric attenuation pattern (Admin Pool up, Journalistic Pool flat) as the one claim where the directionality assumption is most naturally supported, since a media-to-Trump causal path would be difficult to reconcile with that pattern. It assessed C05 as challenged on directionality grounds (p = <span class="stat-notation">0.07</span> and the Fear pool-level divergence implies media-generated Fear signals without evidence for or against this). For C09, it correctly noted that the absence of Admin Pool distrust elevation does not establish that journalistic distrust was generated independently of external political events — a fundamental confound unresolved in the current design.</p>

        <h3>Ethical Implications (Operationalisation Critic)</h3>
        <p>The Operationalisation Critic conducted a systematic pre-registration and construct validity audit. Its principal findings: (1) The ITS OLS in C01 was applied without HAC/Newey-West autocorrelation correction — the reported p = <span class="stat-notation">0.05</span> border significance may not survive corrected standard errors. (2) Multiple post-hoc threshold definitions were identified that lack pre-registration documentation: the 0.4 distrust spike threshold (C09), the convergence parity range (+0.4 to +0.6 z-score in C03), the &quot;negligible&quot; RF importance cutoff (&lt;<span class="stat-notation">0.015</span> in C12), the top-5 RF feature threshold (C11), and the ~10–15 week recovery window (C14). (3) C13 was assessed as challenged on operationalisation grounds given Unknown data quality on its primary variable. (4) C08&#x27;s Moral Unity outlier identification was flagged as a post-hoc visual discovery requiring formal pre-registration of outlier criteria before any replication claim can be made. The Critic rated C16 (direct count), C15 (163-week stability), and C04 (large-sample descriptive ranking) as fully supported with no construct validity concerns.</p>

        <h2>6. META-REASONER ASSESSMENT</h2>
        <p><strong>Decision:</strong> Conditional Pass <strong>Confidence in assessment:</strong> <span class="stat-notation">0.82</span> <strong>Thesis disposition:</strong> Viable with major revisions</p>
        <p>The meta-reasoner assessed 17 claims across all four reasoning models, identified 7 risks (1 critical, 3 major, 3 moderate), 7 opportunities, and 10 action steps. The thesis contains a defensible minimum viable empirical core comprising C04 (Confidence-dominance corrective to the anger hypothesis), C06 (journalistic attenuation of self-promotion and legitimisation), C07 (post-inauguration negative emotion reduction), C11 and C12 (persona-centric versus policy-frame amplification distinction, exploratory), C15 (Moral Absolutes exclusion), and C16 (journalistic volume dominance structural context). This core is sufficient for a Stockwerk 3 scholarly contribution in political communication.</p>
        <p>The most structurally significant risk (R01, Critical/High) is that the thesis&#x27;s central directional amplification framing is not empirically confirmed. The only formal temporal directionality test (C17, Granger causality) fails significance and carries compromised data quality. All claims using &quot;amplification&quot; language may describe co-variation or reverse causality rather than downstream journalistic reproduction of Trump messaging. This is not a fatal flaw in the data — it is an incompleteness in the analytical design that can be resolved by completing the lagged cross-correlation phase analysis (Action Step AS01). Until that analysis is complete, the thesis must replace &quot;amplification&quot; language with &quot;co-variation&quot; or &quot;association&quot; language throughout.</p>
        <p>The meta-reasoner identified a major opportunity (O01) in foregrounding the Confidence-dominance finding as a primary corrective scholarly contribution rather than a secondary descriptive result. The populist anger-framing assumption is a widely-held prior in political communication scholarship; its empirical disconfirmation across 204,222 documents is a more defensible and novel contribution than an unconfirmed amplification argument would be. Similarly, the persona-centric versus policy-frame amplification finding (C11, C12) — supported by cross-model convergence of LASSO and Random Forest — constitutes a theoretically significant contribution independent of the unresolved directionality question.</p>
        <p>Three conditions are non-negotiable before submission: (a) completion or withdrawal of the directional amplification argument (AS01 and AS07); (b) data quality remediation for the Conflict Framing: Trump vs. Democrats variable before the ~2× polarisation gap magnitude claim in C13 can stand (AS02); and (c) pre-registration of all currently post-hoc thresholds before execution of any follow-up analyses (AS10, reassigned to prerequisite status per governance correction COR-01).</p>

        <h2>7. GOVERNANCE VERDICT</h2>
        <p><strong>Overall Status:</strong> Conditional Pass <strong>Handoff cleared:</strong> Yes, subject to six stated conditions <strong>Confidence in verdict:</strong> <span class="stat-notation">0.87</span></p>
        <p>The governance layer evaluated pipeline integrity across five gates:</p>
        <p><strong>Gate G9.7-01 (Pipeline Completeness): PASS.</strong> All upstream steps (9.1 through 9.6) produced complete outputs. Step 9.1 achieved coverage_score = 1.0 across all five analytical layers (Empirical, Logical, Contextual, Meta, Adversarial). Step 9.4 produced 17 claim-evidence pairs. The pipeline is internally consistent.</p>
        <p><strong>Gate G9.7-02 (Critical Blocker Resolution): CONDITIONAL PASS.</strong> Three action plan sequencing failures were identified and corrected. COR-01: AS10 (pre-registration) was incorrectly assigned priority 10 but must precede execution of AS01–AS06 to constitute valid pre-registration; it is reassigned to prerequisite/priority 0 status. Delivering the action plan with AS10 at priority 10 would cause the thesis author to conduct analyses before pre-registration, producing academically invalid post-hoc pre-registration. COR-02: AS07 (directional language revision) was assigned priority 7 but is immediately executable in parallel with AS01 initiation; interim drafts must not circulate with directional amplification language pending this revision; AS07 is reassigned to priority 1b. COR-03: C13&#x27;s publishability flag must be explicitly suspended until AS02 data quality remediation is confirmed complete.</p>
        <p><strong>Gate G9.7-03 (Minimum Viable Core Integrity): PASS.</strong> The seven-claim minimum viable core (C04, C06, C07, C11, C12, C15, C16) is sufficient for a Stockwerk 3 contribution in political communication scholarship, particularly when framed around empirical disconfirmation of the anger hypothesis, identification of persona-centric amplification registers, and documentation of post-inauguration journalistic normalisation.</p>
        <p><strong>Gate G9.7-04 (Critical Risk Disclosure Adequacy): PASS.</strong> R01 (unconfirmed directional amplification), R02 (data quality failure on polarisation variable), R03 (IDX_AMP composite conflation), and CONTR-04 (directional amplification logic failure) are all explicitly severity-coded and linked to specific claims and action steps. The Conditional Pass gatekeeping status cannot be misread as unconditional approval.</p>
        <p><strong>Gate G9.7-05 (Action Plan Executability): CONDITIONAL PASS.</strong> Residual specification gaps in AS01 (lag window range not specified; minimum phase-cell N not specified; directional inference criterion not specified) and AS04 (Transition Window boundary not pre-defined) require communication to the thesis author alongside the action plan. Three scope specifications (SPEC-01, SPEC-02, SPEC-03) have been appended to the governance record. Notably, AS01 + AS03 + AS04 collectively constitute a second analytical cycle of substantial scope (estimated 4–8 weeks of full-time analytical work); the thesis author must not treat these as minor revisions.</p>
        <p><strong>Four non-negotiable pre-submission requirements:</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>AS01 (lagged cross-correlation phase analysis) must be completed, OR all directional amplification language must be permanently withdrawn from thesis text.</li>
            <li>AS02 (data quality remediation for the Conflict Framing: Trump vs. Democrats variable) must be resolved, OR C13 must be reclassified as exploratory with the ~2× magnitude claim removed.</li>
            <li>AS07 (directional language revision) must be implemented immediately in all thesis drafts circulated to supervisors or committee.</li>
            <li>AS10 (pre-registration) must be filed and confirmed BEFORE execution of AS01–AS06 analyses.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>8. DATA QUALITY ASSESSMENT</h2>
        <p>The data quality assessment for this corpus identified no variables with critical quality status (critical quality failures = false). The lowest quality score in the dataset is <span class="stat-notation">0.50</span>, assigned to a single variable. Two variables received formal quality assessments:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Entman Problem Framing</strong> (<code>entman_analysis_entman_problem</code>): quality score = <span class="stat-notation">0.699</span>, status = Good. No material data quality concerns affect claims relying on this variable.</li>
            <li><strong>Conflict Framing: Trump vs. Democrats</strong> (<code>big8_conflict_lines_big8_scores_trump_vs_democrats</code>): quality score = <span class="stat-notation">0.50</span>, status = <strong>Unknown</strong>. No warning tag was generated, but the Unknown status indicates that data completeness, coding reliability, or source representativeness for this variable could not be verified through standard quality checks.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Unknown status of the Conflict Framing: Trump vs. Democrats variable has direct, material consequences for two claims:</p>
        <p><strong>C13 (Admin Pool polarisation ceiling)</strong> relies on this variable as a primary constituent of its polarisation sub-index. The quantitative claim that the Admin Pool Us-vs-Them framing was &quot;approximately double&quot; the Journalistic Pool equivalent (<span class="stat-notation">0.25</span>–<span class="stat-notation">0.45</span> vs. approximately half that) cannot be confirmed until this variable&#x27;s quality is remediated. The claim is currently flagged as supported and publishable in the underlying data, but the governance layer has suspended its publishability flag (COR-03) pending remediation. Until that remediation is complete, C13&#x27;s magnitude characterisation must be qualified and should not be presented as confirmed in thesis text or committee submissions.</p>
        <p><strong>C17 (Granger causality temporal lead)</strong> also depends on this variable as part of the Admin Pool time-series used in the Granger test. The combination of Unknown data quality and sub-threshold significance (p = <span class="stat-notation">0.10</span>) means the Granger causality estimate has insufficient reliability for any directional inference. All four reasoning models assessed C17 as challenged for reasons that include, but are not limited to, this data quality concern.</p>
        <p>It should be noted that the absence of critical-status variables prevents this quality issue from constituting a hard pipeline blocker at the corpus-wide level. However, for the subset of claims touching polarisation and conflict framing sub-indices, the Unknown quality designation represents a meaningful limitation on quantitative precision that must be disclosed wherever C13 magnitude estimates are cited.</p>

        <h2>9. LIMITATIONS</h2>
        <p><strong>1. Unconfirmed directional amplification logic.</strong> The central thesis question asks about journalistic amplification of Trump&#x27;s messaging — a directional, quasi-causal claim. The only formal test of temporal precedence (Granger causality, C17) fails conventional significance (p = <span class="stat-notation">0.10</span>) and is compromised by data quality issues. All 17 claims describe co-variation and structural association between Admin Pool and Journalistic Pool content; none confirms that Trump&#x27;s messaging temporally precedes or causally shapes journalistic framing. This limitation is not peripheral to the thesis — it is the thesis&#x27;s primary empirical gap.</p>
        <p><strong>2. Binary phase design and Transition Window conflation.</strong> The pre/post-inauguration binary design embeds the ~10-week Transition Window (approximately 2024-W44 to 2025-W02) within the pre-inauguration phase. Anticipatory journalistic repositioning in the Transition Window may inflate the apparent sharpness of the structural break at 2025-W03, downward-bias the pre-inauguration IDX_AMP baseline, and confound temporal attribution for claims C01, C02, C03, C08, C09, C13, and C14.</p>
        <p><strong>3. IDX_AMP composite conflation.</strong> The primary amplification index conflates frequency-amplification and frame-fidelity amplification without decomposition. The internal tension between C11 (Self Promotion dominates IDX_AMP) and C06 (journalistic coverage shows near-zero Self Promotion effect post-inauguration) reveals that the composite masks opposing movements across sub-dimensions. Post-inauguration convergence in C03 may partly be an artefact of this conflation.</p>
        <p><strong>4. Small effect sizes throughout.</strong> No large effects are detected across any of the 17 claims. Cohen&#x27;s d ranges from <span class="stat-notation">0.22</span> (C17) to <span class="stat-notation">0.42</span> (C04), with the majority of supported claims in the <span class="stat-notation">0.28</span>–<span class="stat-notation">0.38</span> range. This pattern is consistent with statistically detectable but practically modest dynamics. The thesis narrative must not overstate the magnitude of observed associations.</p>
        <p><strong>5. ITS OLS without HAC autocorrelation correction.</strong> The ITS OLS segmented regression models (C01, C14) were estimated with standard OLS standard errors. No HAC/Newey-West correction was applied, and residual autocorrelation in weekly series was not formally tested. The p = <span class="stat-notation">0.05</span> border-significant results for C01 may not survive HAC correction; this requires remediation.</p>
        <p><strong>6. Post-hoc threshold definitions.</strong> Multiple characterisations involve thresholds derived from the observed data rather than pre-registered criteria: the 0.4 distrust spike threshold (C09), convergence parity range (+0.4 to +0.6 z-score, C03), RF importance &quot;negligibility&quot; cutoff (&lt;<span class="stat-notation">0.015</span>, C12), top-5 feature threshold (C11), and ~10–15 week polarisation recovery window (C14). These thresholds must be pre-registered before any follow-up analysis cycle is executed to convert them from exploratory to confirmatory.</p>
        <p><strong>7. Data quality limitation on polarisation variable.</strong> The Conflict Framing: Trump vs. Democrats variable carries Unknown quality status (quality score = <span class="stat-notation">0.50</span>). Magnitude claims in C13 and the directional inference in C17 are affected. This limitation reduces the reliability of quantitative characterisations of the Trump-vs-Democrats conflict framing sub-index throughout the polarisation analysis.</p>
        <p><strong>8. C07/C09 internal Distrust trajectory tension.</strong> C07 documents a systematic post-inauguration reduction in Distrust (r approaching −0.6), while C09 describes repeated post-inauguration Distrust spikes above 0.4. Both concern the same variable in the same post-inauguration period. This apparent directional inconsistency requires temporal sub-phase modelling to determine whether suppression and spiking occur in distinct sequential sub-windows, or whether the two claims describe conflicting dynamics that cannot be reconciled with the current binary phase design.</p>
        <p><strong>9. Corpus sampling representativeness.</strong> The corpus was drawn from specific outlet selections and time windows. Generalisability of the <span class="stat-notation">5.78</span>× volume ratio (C16), emotion leaderboard rankings (C04), and pool-level frame differences to the broader media ecosystem depends on sampling representativeness that has not been formally assessed. Findings should be interpreted as characterising this corpus rather than the full spectrum of journalistic Trump coverage.</p>
        <p><strong>10. Emotion scores are model-generated.</strong> All emotion intensity measures are produced by automated text analysis models. They represent modelled intensity estimates calibrated to the model&#x27;s internal scale and may not directly correspond to reader-perceived emotional salience, journalist intentionality, or the actual affective content of articles as experienced by audiences.</p>
