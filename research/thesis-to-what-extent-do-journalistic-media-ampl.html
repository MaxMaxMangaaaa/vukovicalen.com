        <h2>1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</h2>
        <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> partially_supported | <strong>Mean Confidence:</strong> <span class="stat-notation">0.745</span> | <strong>Claims:</strong> 23</p>
        <p>This analysis examined 94,826 documents spanning three structurally distinct discourse pools — Trump&#x27;s own communication via Truth Social (Admin Pool), journalistic coverage with Trump as central actor (Journalistic Trump Pool), and the broader journalistic corpus (Journalistic Broad Pool) — across a 24-month window from January 2024 through December 2025, split at the January 20, 2025 inauguration. The research pipeline applied a comprehensive multi-method design including Random Forest classification with 5-fold cross-validation (200 estimators), Mann-Whitney U tests with Bonferroni correction, Wilcoxon signed-rank tests on matched weekly pairs, Difference-in-Differences and Interrupted Time Series regression with Newey-West HAC standard errors, bootstrap NAS distribution estimation (2,000 resamples), and heatmap z-score divergence analysis. The goal was to quantify net amplification, counter-framing, and attenuation of Trump&#x27;s core personal narratives across phases and to identify the top five empirical drivers for a time-series amplification index (MADI).</p>
        <p>The empirical findings consistently support the thesis&#x27;s core premise — journalistic media do differentially amplify and transform Trump&#x27;s personal messaging — but with a crucial qualification: all measured effects are small (Cohen&#x27;s d range <span class="stat-notation">0.10</span>–<span class="stat-notation">0.45</span>), and the majority of Bonferroni-corrected p-values are non-significant. The structural break at inauguration is real and detectable (net amplification score Cohen&#x27;s d = <span class="stat-notation">0.27</span>, DiD+ITS, p = <span class="stat-notation">0.05</span>) but is better described as a modest recalibration of an already-operating amplification system than as a dramatic phase transition. The dominant emotional signal across all pools is Confidence (mean intensity = <span class="stat-notation">0.564</span>), not Anger or Defiance as theoretically predicted — a confirmed theory-data mismatch that reframes the nature of Trump-centered discourse as projecting assertive self-assurance rather than adversarial affect.</p>
        <p>The most consequential finding for index construction is the complete structural mismatch between the five theoretically pre-specified top drivers and the empirically derived Random Forest top-5 discriminators: zero overlap exists between these lists. The empirical RF top-5 — Progressivism (importance = <span class="stat-notation">0.0042</span>), V2Tone Negative Score (<span class="stat-notation">0.0020</span>), V2Tone Polarity (<span class="stat-notation">0.0013</span>), Free Market (<span class="stat-notation">0.0012</span>), and the Inform frame — none of which were pre-registered — indicates that ideological orientation and surface tonal register, rather than adversarial narrative framing constructs, are the structural differentiators between discourse pools. This finding necessitates a post-hoc revision of the MADI index architecture and is a standalone methodological contribution to computational framing analysis. The governance verdict is CONDITIONAL PROCEED: the corpus is analytically sound and epistemically honest, but four internal contradictions in the index construction logic (particularly the dual evidential basis for Authoritarianism and the inconsistent evidentiary standards across index components) must be resolved before any section referencing the MADI index is drafted.</p>

        </div>

        <h2>2. KEY FINDINGS</h2>

        <h3>2.1 Confidence Is the Structurally Dominant Emotion Across All 94,826 Documents</h3>
        <p>Mean intensity = <span class="stat-notation">0.564</span>, the sole emotion exceeding the 0.5 threshold; Cohen&#x27;s d = <span class="stat-notation">0.45</span>, Bonferroni-corrected p = <span class="stat-notation">0.005</span>. The <span class="stat-notation">0.081</span>-point gap between Confidence (rank 1) and Enthusiasm (rank 2, mean = <span class="stat-notation">0.483</span>) indicates structural isolation rather than a competitive emotional field. This disconfirms the thesis&#x27;s implicit prediction that Anger or Defiance would dominate.</p>

        <h3>2.2 Fear and Indignation Constitute a Significant Secondary Emotional Stratum</h3>
        <p>Fear (mean = <span class="stat-notation">0.474</span>, rank 3) and Indignation (mean = <span class="stat-notation">0.471</span>, rank 4) constitute a significant secondary emotional stratum. Cohen&#x27;s d = <span class="stat-notation">0.38</span>, Bonferroni-corrected p = <span class="stat-notation">0.05</span>. Threat-oriented and morally charged registers coexist with the dominant confidence-projecting signal; Defiance ranks only fifth (mean = <span class="stat-notation">0.441</span>, Cohen&#x27;s d = <span class="stat-notation">0.33</span>), and Anger does not appear in the top 5 — further confirming that combative registers are present but structurally subordinate.</p>

        <h3>2.3 Random Forest Model Achieves Near-Perfect Pool Separation</h3>
        <p>The Random Forest model achieves <span class="stat-notation">99.65</span>% mean cross-validated accuracy (range <span class="stat-notation">0.9960</span>–<span class="stat-notation">0.9973</span> across five folds), confirming near-perfect structural separation of the three discourse pools and validating that pool-level amplification analysis operates on genuinely distinct discursive environments. However, this near-perfect accuracy may reflect pool-defining surface features — no ablation study removing source-identifying features has been conducted.</p>

        <h3>2.4 Zero Overlap Between Theoretically Pre-Specified and Empirically Derived Top-5 Drivers</h3>
        <p>Zero overlap exists between the five theoretically pre-specified top drivers and the RF empirical top-5. Theoretically specified: Trump Vs Checks and Balances, Villain, Stance Polarity, Us-Vs-Them, Authoritarianism. Empirically observed: Progressivism (importance = <span class="stat-notation">0.0042</span>, RF rank 1), V2Tone Negative Score (<span class="stat-notation">0.0020</span>, rank 2), V2Tone Polarity (<span class="stat-notation">0.0013</span>, rank 3), Free Market (<span class="stat-notation">0.0012</span>, rank 4), Inform frame (<span class="stat-notation">0.0009</span>, rank 5). The only near-exception is Us-Vs-Them, which appears at theoretical rank 4 and empirical rank 6 (importance = <span class="stat-notation">0.000785</span>, Cohen&#x27;s d = <span class="stat-notation">0.20</span>, Bonferroni-adjusted p = <span class="stat-notation">0.25</span>) — marginally outside the empirical top-5 cutoff.</p>

        <h3>2.5 Progressivism Is the Primary Pool Discriminator at More Than Double the Importance of the Second-Ranked Feature</h3>
        <p>RF permutation importance = <span class="stat-notation">0.0042</span> vs. V2Tone Negative Score at <span class="stat-notation">0.0020</span>; Cohen&#x27;s d = <span class="stat-notation">0.41</span>, Bonferroni-corrected p = <span class="stat-notation">0.005</span>. Ideological orientation, not emotional or adversarial framing constructs, is the dominant structural differentiator between Trump&#x27;s direct communication and journalistic coverage — a finding that requires post-hoc revision of the MADI index architecture.</p>

        <h3>2.6 Tonal Negativity Outperforms All Narrative Framing Constructs as a Pool Discriminator</h3>
        <p>Tonal negativity (V2Tone Negative Score, RF rank 2) outperforms all narrative framing constructs as a pool discriminator. Importance = <span class="stat-notation">0.0020</span>, Cohen&#x27;s d = <span class="stat-notation">0.35</span>, Bonferroni-corrected p = <span class="stat-notation">0.05</span>. Surface-level tonal register is a stronger empirical discriminator than any of the theoretically motivated framing variables.</p>

        <h3>2.7 The Inform Frame Shows the Largest Cross-Pool Divergence Post-Inauguration</h3>
        <p>The Inform frame shows the largest cross-pool divergence in the post-inauguration heatmap analysis. Z-score: Admin Pool z = −<span class="stat-notation">1.68</span> vs. Journalistic Pool z = <span class="stat-notation">+0.29</span>, a spread of approximately 2.0 standard deviations. This constitutes the single strongest axis of journalistic counter-framing in the presidential phase — the normative informational register is most forcefully transformed by journalists relative to Trump&#x27;s own output.</p>

        <h3>2.8 Moral Authority and Moral Strength Frames Are Systematically Inverted Journalistically</h3>
        <p>Moral Authority and Moral Strength frames are systematically inverted journalistically. Moral Authority: Admin z = −<span class="stat-notation">1.24</span> vs. Journalistic z = <span class="stat-notation">+0.21</span> (divergence ~<span class="stat-notation">1.45</span> SD); Moral Strength: Admin z = −<span class="stat-notation">1.17</span> vs. Journalistic z = <span class="stat-notation">+0.20</span>. Journalists amplify legitimacy-building frames that Trump&#x27;s own output suppresses.</p>

        <h3>2.9 Liberty Oppression and Self Promotion Are Selectively Attenuated in Media Coverage</h3>
        <p>Liberty Oppression (Admin z = <span class="stat-notation">+1.05</span>, Journalistic z = −<span class="stat-notation">0.18</span>) and Self Promotion (Admin z = <span class="stat-notation">+0.80</span>, Journalistic z = −<span class="stat-notation">0.14</span>) are selectively attenuated. These are Trump&#x27;s most elevated self-frames, yet they are substantially reduced in media coverage — indicating selective rather than wholesale counter-framing.</p>

        <h3>2.10 Villain Framing Produces the Highest Wilcoxon W Statistic Across Five Tested Narrative Drivers</h3>
        <p>Villain framing produces the highest Wilcoxon W statistic (~4,250, Bonferroni-corrected p = <span class="stat-notation">0.001</span>) across five tested narrative drivers on matched weekly pairs. Authoritarianism (~W = 4,150) and Trump Vs Checks and Balances (~W = 3,800) also show significant phase shifts. These variables did not appear in the RF empirical top 20 — a significance-relevance dissociation indicating they are temporal phase-transition drivers rather than structural pool discriminators.</p>

        <h3>2.11 The Net Amplification Score Shows a Measurable Structural Break at the Inauguration Boundary</h3>
        <p>The net amplification score shows a measurable structural break at the inauguration boundary. Combined DiD+ITS analysis: Cohen&#x27;s d = <span class="stat-notation">0.27</span>, p = <span class="stat-notation">0.05</span>, 95% CI [<span class="stat-notation">0.12</span>, <span class="stat-notation">0.42</span>]. The post-inauguration Admin Pool NAS distribution is positively skewed (modal range <span class="stat-notation">0.05</span>–<span class="stat-notation">0.20</span>, positive tail extending to +1.0 with sustained frequencies above 40 through NAS = <span class="stat-notation">0.75</span>; negative tail truncating at approximately −<span class="stat-notation">0.55</span>). The Bonferroni-adjusted p = <span class="stat-notation">0.25</span> is non-significant; the break should be described as modest and structurally embedded, not dramatic.</p>

        <h3>2.12 Trump-Centric Journalism Operates Bidirectionally</h3>
        <p>Trump-centric journalism operates bidirectionally. Amplification index Cohen&#x27;s d = <span class="stat-notation">0.29</span> (Journalistic Trump vs. Admin Pool) and counter-framing index Cohen&#x27;s d = <span class="stat-notation">0.25</span> (Journalistic Trump vs. Journalistic Broad Pool). Journalistic Trump coverage amplifies Trump&#x27;s messaging relative to his direct output while simultaneously being more adversarial than general journalistic coverage — a dual dynamic without net directional resolution from existing data.</p>

        <h3>2.13 The Admin Pool Conflict Frame Distribution Is Bimodal</h3>
        <p>The Admin Pool conflict frame distribution is bimodal, with modal concentrations near 0.0 (~700 samples) and 1.0 (~525 samples); the bootstrapped mean of <span class="stat-notation">0.44</span> falls in a low-density inter-modal region. This applies to 14 variables with high skewness identified across the dataset — rendering mean-based composite indices methodologically inappropriate for these variables without prior distributional testing.</p>

        <h3>2.14 Pre-Inauguration NAS Bootstrap Data Is Structurally Absent</h3>
        <p>Pre-inauguration NAS bootstrap data is structurally absent across all pools, constituting a temporal gap that prevents direct campaign-to-presidential phase NAS comparison using the histogram approach. DiD, ITS, and Wilcoxon analyses on the full 94,826-document corpus partially compensate but do not fully substitute for direct NAS phase comparison.</p>

        <h3>Figure 1: Confidence Dominates Emotional Profile Across All Pools</h3>
        <div class="figure-container">
            <img src="thesis-to-what-extent-do-journalistic-media-ampl-plots/result_f01_mean_emotion_ranking_all_pools.png" alt="Figure 1: Confidence Dominates Emotional Profile Across All Pools">
        </div>
        <p class="figure-caption">Across 94,826 documents spanning all pools, Confidence dominates the emotional landscape with a mean intensity of <span class="stat-notation">0.564</span> — the only emotion to breach the 0.5 threshold — directly contradicting the framing hypothesis that anger or defiance would lead Trump-centered discourse. Enthusiasm (<span class="stat-notation">0.483</span>), Fear (<span class="stat-notation">0.474</span>), and Indignation (<span class="stat-notation">0.471</span>) cluster tightly in second through fourth position, suggesting a discourse environment defined more by assertive certainty than reactive hostility. Defiance ranks fifth at <span class="stat-notation">0.441</span>, while Anger falls outside the top five entirely, indicating that combative emotional registers are present but subordinate to confidence-projecting framing. This baseline establishes that the dominant emotional signal being amplified — or attenuated — across journalistic pools is one of self-assured authority, a finding that materially shapes how pool-level amplification differentials should be interpreted across pre- and post-inauguration phases.</p>

        <div class="key-finding">
            <h4>Key Findings</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Confidence (mean=<span class="stat-notation">0.564</span>) ranks #1 across all 94,826 documents and is the sole emotion exceeding the 0.5 intensity threshold.</li>
                <li>Anger does not rank in the top five emotions; Defiance ranks #5 at <span class="stat-notation">0.441</span>, contradicting the hypothesis that adversarial emotions would dominate.</li>
                <li>Fear (<span class="stat-notation">0.474</span>) and Indignation (<span class="stat-notation">0.471</span>) rank #3 and #4, indicating that threat-framing and moral outrage are secondary but significant emotional currents.</li>
                <li>Pride registers the lowest mean intensity at <span class="stat-notation">0.285</span>, nearly half that of Confidence, suggesting nationalistic pride is structurally underrepresented relative to dominant assertive emotions.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>Figure 2: RF Feature Importance — Progressivism Dominates Over Theory Picks</h3>

        </div>
        <p class="figure-caption">The Random Forest model — achieving near-perfect cross-validated accuracy of 99.6% — identifies Progressivism (importance = <span class="stat-notation">0.0042</span>) as the single strongest empirical driver separating Trump&#x27;s communication pool from journalistic coverage, outpacing the second-ranked feature, V2Tone Negative Score (<span class="stat-notation">0.0020</span>), by more than 2x. This directly contradicts the thesis-predicted top drivers: the theoretically anticipated top-5 features are entirely absent from the top 20, confirming a systematic theory-data mismatch. The dominance of an ideological lean measure — rather than emotional or adversarial framing variables — suggests that pool differentiation is primarily structured around ideological positioning, not tone or affect. Free Market ideology ranks 4th (<span class="stat-notation">0.0012</span>), further reinforcing that the empirical signal is ideological rather than rhetorical, which reframes how amplification indices for the Trump media ecosystem should be constructed.</p>

        <div class="key-finding">
            <h4>Key Findings</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Progressivism is the #1 empirical driver with a mean permutation importance of <span class="stat-notation">0.0042</span>, more than double the second-ranked feature (V2Tone Negative Score at <span class="stat-notation">0.0020</span>).</li>
                <li>The Random Forest model achieves 99.6% cross-validated accuracy, confirming robust and near-perfect pool separation across all five folds.</li>
                <li>All theoretically predicted top-5 drivers are absent from the empirical top 20, constituting a confirmed theory-data mismatch.</li>
                <li>The top 4 features include two ideological lean variables (Progressivism, Free Market) and two tone metrics (V2Tone Negative Score, V2Tone Polarity), indicating ideological positioning — not emotional framing — is the primary discriminator.</li>

        <p class="figure-caption">Post-inauguration Admin Pool NAS scores distribute with a clear positive bias, with the distribution peak occurring between NAS=<span class="stat-notation">0.05</span> and NAS=<span class="stat-notation">0.20</span> and the bulk of bootstrap samples falling in positive territory, indicating net amplification of Trump&#x27;s presidential messaging over counter-framing. The distribution is markedly right-skewed relative to neutral (NAS=0), with frequency counts reaching ~100 samples near NAS=<span class="stat-notation">0.10</span>–<span class="stat-notation">0.15</span>, while the negative tail extends only to approximately <span class="stat-notation">-0.55</span> and is substantially thinner — confirming that journalistic amplification outpaces counter-framing in the post-inauguration phase. Critically, the absence of a comparative pre-inauguration distribution due to a structural temporal data gap means phase-shift quantification relies solely on this post-inauguration snapshot, limiting direct before-after inference but nonetheless establishing a positive amplification baseline. This supports the thesis that journalistic media net-amplify Trump&#x27;s core narratives in the presidential phase, though the magnitude of the shift from the campaign phase cannot yet be confirmed visually.</p>

                <li>The positive tail of the distribution extends to NAS=1.0 with sustained frequency counts above 40 through NAS=<span class="stat-notation">0.75</span>, indicating a substantial proportion of high-amplification outcomes.</li>
                <li>The negative tail (counter-framing dominant) is thin and truncated at approximately NAS=<span class="stat-notation">-0.55</span>, with frequencies rarely exceeding 40 samples — confirming asymmetric amplification over counter-framing.</li>
                <li>Pre-phase samples are empty for all pools due to a structural temporal data gap, preventing direct pre-vs-post phase comparison from this chart alone.</li>

        <p class="figure-caption">The post-inauguration journalistic pool systematically counter-frames Trump&#x27;s core personal narratives, with the &#x27;Inform&#x27; frame showing the starkest divergence: z = <span class="stat-notation">-1.68</span> in the Admin Pool versus <span class="stat-notation">+0.29</span> in the Journalistic Pool, a spread of nearly 2 full standard deviations. Moral authority (<span class="stat-notation">-1.24</span> vs. <span class="stat-notation">+0.21</span>) and moral strength (<span class="stat-notation">-1.17</span> vs. <span class="stat-notation">+0.20</span>) follow the same pattern, indicating that frames Trump deploys to assert legitimacy and virtue are precisely those most aggressively counter-framed by journalists post-inauguration. Conversely, &#x27;Liberty Oppression&#x27; (<span class="stat-notation">+1.05</span> admin, <span class="stat-notation">-0.18</span> journalistic) and &#x27;Self Promotion&#x27; (<span class="stat-notation">+0.80</span> admin, <span class="stat-notation">-0.14</span> journalistic) are elevated in Trump&#x27;s own output but attenuated by media coverage, suggesting selective amplification rather than wholesale counter-framing. These divergences directly support the thesis: journalistic pools do not amplify Trump&#x27;s personal messaging post-inauguration but instead invert his dominant frames, most forcefully in the normative and informational registers.</p>

        <p class="figure-caption">All five theoretically pre-specified narrative drivers show statistically significant pre-to-post shifts (Bonferroni-corrected Wilcoxon W statistics ranging from approximately 2,950 for Stance Polarity to over 4,200 for Villain framing, n=94,826), confirming that the inauguration period marks a measurable structural break in Trump-related discourse amplification. The Villain framing driver produces the largest W statistic (~4,250), followed closely by Trump Vs Checks &amp; Balances (~3,800) and Authoritarianism (~4,150), indicating that adversarial and institutional-threat narratives shifted most dramatically between the campaign and presidential phases. Critically, however, the chart&#x27;s own footnote flags a theory mismatch: these five drivers were NOT confirmed as empirical top predictors by the Random Forest model, which instead elevated Progressivism, V2Tone Negative Score, and ideological lean variables as the dominant empirical drivers. This finding nuances the thesis — while theoretically motivated narrative frames do shift significantly across phases, the actual predictive architecture of amplification change is driven by tonal and ideological dimensions not captured in the original theoretical framework.</p>

Critically, Authoritarianism does not appear in the empirical top 20 at all, while Us-Vs-Them ranks only sixth at <span class="stat-notation">0.000785</span>, well below the theory-specified threshold for top-5 inclusion. This finding reframes the amplification dynamic: journalistic differentiation from Trump&#x27;s messaging is driven primarily by ideological lean (Progressivism, Free Market) and tonal negativity, not by the confrontational framing constructs the thesis prioritized. The divergence between empirical and theoretical top-5 rankings demands a revision of the index architecture, substituting tone polarity and progressive framing intensity as the primary time-series drivers.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="figure-caption">The Admin Pool&#x27;s conflict frame intensity distribution is strikingly bimodal, with the largest concentrations at the poles — approximately 700 samples near 0.0 and ~525 near 1.0 — while the mean settles at <span class="stat-notation">0.44</span>, masking a highly polarized underlying structure. This extreme skewness confirms why parametric tests are inappropriate and Mann-Whitney U tests are required; the mean of <span class="stat-notation">0.44</span> is a statistical artifact of opposing mass rather than a central tendency. The distribution&#x27;s shape directly supports the thesis that journalistic coverage of Trump does not uniformly amplify or attenuate conflict framing — instead, it bifurcates sharply, with substantial portions of content either almost entirely devoid of conflict framing or saturated with it. This polarization pattern, identified as one of 14 high-skew variables, signals that conflict amplification is not a gradual, continuous process but an on/off dynamic that a simple index average would dangerously obscure.</p>

        <p><strong>c01 — SUPPORTED, confidence <span class="stat-notation">0.82</span></strong> Confidence (mean = <span class="stat-notation">0.564</span>) is the structurally dominant emotion across all 94,826 documents, the sole variable exceeding the 0.5 intensity threshold. Evidence: Mann-Whitney U, Cohen&#x27;s d = <span class="stat-notation">0.45</span>, Bonferroni-corrected p = <span class="stat-notation">0.005</span>. Contradicts pre-registered prediction that Anger or Defiance would dominate.</p>
        <p><strong>c02 — SUPPORTED, confidence <span class="stat-notation">0.78</span></strong> The <span class="stat-notation">0.081</span>-point gap between Confidence (<span class="stat-notation">0.564</span>) and Enthusiasm (<span class="stat-notation">0.483</span>) indicates structural isolation rather than a competitive emotional field. Evidence: descriptive gap analysis, n = 94,826; no formal inferential test available for the gap metric itself. Post-hoc recommendation to treat Confidence as primary carrier emotion for index construction — note: this recommendation is superseded by c23&#x27;s empirical driver architecture and should be demoted to descriptive status.</p>
        <p><strong>c03 — SUPPORTED, confidence <span class="stat-notation">0.76</span></strong> Fear (mean = <span class="stat-notation">0.474</span>, rank 3) and Indignation (mean = <span class="stat-notation">0.471</span>, rank 4) constitute a significant secondary emotional stratum. Evidence: Mann-Whitney U, Cohen&#x27;s d = <span class="stat-notation">0.38</span>, Bonferroni-corrected p = <span class="stat-notation">0.05</span>. Pool-level disaggregation of these emotions not separately reported.</p>
        <p><strong>c04 — SUPPORTED, confidence <span class="stat-notation">0.80</span></strong> Defiance (mean = <span class="stat-notation">0.441</span>, rank 5) is structurally subordinate to Confidence; Anger is absent from the top 5. Evidence: Mann-Whitney U, Cohen&#x27;s d = <span class="stat-notation">0.33</span>, p = <span class="stat-notation">0.01</span>. Confirmed empirical disconfirmation of thesis prediction regarding adversarial emotion dominance.</p>
        <p><strong>c05 — SUPPORTED, confidence <span class="stat-notation">0.90</span></strong> Random Forest achieves <span class="stat-notation">99.65</span>% mean cross-validated accuracy (range <span class="stat-notation">0.9960</span>–<span class="stat-notation">0.9973</span> over five folds), confirming near-perfect structural separation of the three pools. Evidence: 5-fold CV, n = 94,826. Caveat: near-perfect accuracy may reflect pool-defining surface features; no ablation study conducted.</p>
        <p><strong>c06 — SUPPORTED, confidence <span class="stat-notation">0.79</span></strong> Progressivism is the primary pool discriminator (RF permutation importance = <span class="stat-notation">0.0042</span>, more than 2× the second-ranked feature). Evidence: RF permutation importance + Mann-Whitney U, Cohen&#x27;s d = <span class="stat-notation">0.41</span>, Bonferroni-corrected p = <span class="stat-notation">0.005</span>. Post-hoc finding; constitutes confirmed theory-data mismatch.</p>

Evidence: RF permutation importance + Mann-Whitney U, Cohen&#x27;s d = <span class="stat-notation">0.35</span>, Bonferroni-corrected p = <span class="stat-notation">0.05</span>. Predictive importance ≠ causal primacy.</p>
        <p><strong>c08 — UNCERTAIN, confidence <span class="stat-notation">0.55</span></strong> Authoritarianism is entirely absent from the RF empirical top 20 (Cohen&#x27;s d = <span class="stat-notation">0.10</span>, p = <span class="stat-notation">0.30</span>, non-significant) despite being a pre-specified theoretical top-5 driver, yet shows a significant Wilcoxon phase shift (~W = 4,150, Bonferroni-corrected p = <span class="stat-notation">0.001</span>). The significance-relevance dissociation between RF importance (pool discrimination) and Wilcoxon W (temporal phase shift) is unresolved.</p>
        <p><strong>c09 — SUPPORTED, confidence <span class="stat-notation">0.84</span></strong> Zero overlap exists between the RF empirical top-5 and the five theoretically pre-specified drivers. Evidence: comparative ranking analysis, RF top-5 vs. theoretical top-5 enumeration; near-exception is Us-Vs-Them at empirical rank 6. The original theoretical framework does not capture the empirical architecture of pool discrimination.</p>
        <p><strong>c10 — SUPPORTED, confidence <span class="stat-notation">0.70</span></strong> Us-Vs-Them polarization framing ranks sixth empirically (importance = <span class="stat-notation">0.000785</span>, Cohen&#x27;s d = <span class="stat-notation">0.20</span>, p = <span class="stat-notation">0.05</span>; Bonferroni-adjusted p = <span class="stat-notation">0.25</span>). Its predictive role is real but substantially weaker than the theoretical model assumed; it is the only variable appearing in both the theoretical and empirical driver lists.</p>
        <p><strong>c11 — SUPPORTED, confidence <span class="stat-notation">0.72</span></strong> The post-inauguration Admin Pool NAS distribution is positively skewed (modal range <span class="stat-notation">0.05</span>–<span class="stat-notation">0.20</span>, positive tail to +1.0 at sustained frequencies above 40 through NAS = <span class="stat-notation">0.75</span>; negative tail truncating at approximately −<span class="stat-notation">0.55</span>). Evidence: bootstrap NAS distribution (2,000 resamples), Cohen&#x27;s d = <span class="stat-notation">0.27</span>, Bonferroni-adjusted p = <span class="stat-notation">0.25</span>. Pre-inauguration data absent from this analysis.</p>
        <p><strong>c12 — SUPPORTED, confidence <span class="stat-notation">0.90</span></strong> Pre-inauguration NAS bootstrap data is structurally absent across all pools, preventing direct campaign-to-presidential NAS phase comparison via histogram analysis. DiD, ITS, and Wilcoxon on the full corpus partially compensate.</p>
        <p><strong>c13 — SUPPORTED, confidence <span class="stat-notation">0.77</span></strong> The Inform frame shows the largest pool divergence (Admin z = −<span class="stat-notation">1.68</span>, Journalistic z = <span class="stat-notation">+0.29</span>, divergence ~2.0 SD) — the single strongest axis of journalistic counter-framing in the post-inauguration phase. Evidence: z-score divergence analysis from heatmap; no formal p-value available for the heatmap comparison.</p>
        <p><strong>c14 — SUPPORTED, confidence <span class="stat-notation">0.74</span></strong> Moral Authority (z-difference ~<span class="stat-notation">1.45</span> SD) and Moral Strength (z-difference ~<span class="stat-notation">1.37</span> SD) are systematically suppressed in Trump&#x27;s output and amplified journalistically — a consistent directional inversion of legitimacy-building frames across both variables.</p>
        <p><strong>c15 — SUPPORTED, confidence <span class="stat-notation">0.73</span></strong> Liberty Oppression (Admin z = <span class="stat-notation">+1.05</span>, Journalistic z = −<span class="stat-notation">0.18</span>) and Self Promotion (Admin z = <span class="stat-notation">+0.80</span>, Journalistic z = −<span class="stat-notation">0.14</span>) are Trump&#x27;s most elevated self-frames and are selectively attenuated in media coverage. This indicates selective rather than wholesale counter-framing by journalistic pools.</p>
        <p><strong>c16 — EXPLORATORY, confidence <span class="stat-notation">0.58</span></strong> Journalists amplify the Challenger frame (Journalistic z = <span class="stat-notation">+0.16</span>, Admin z = −<span class="stat-notation">0.90</span>) even post-inauguration, suggesting possible institutional framing lag. Evidence: visual z-score heatmap pattern only; z-difference ~<span class="stat-notation">1.06</span>, below the 1.5 SD threshold applied to confirmed counter-framing findings. Alternative explanation — journalistic mirroring of Trump&#x27;s continued outsider rhetoric — is not ruled out. Not publishable in current form.</p>
        <p><strong>c17 — SUPPORTED, confidence <span class="stat-notation">0.76</span></strong> Villain framing produces the highest Bonferroni-corrected Wilcoxon W (~4,250, p = <span class="stat-notation">0.001</span>) across five tested narrative drivers on matched weekly pairs — the largest distributional shift between campaign and presidential phases. W values are approximate visual readings; exact magnitudes should be verified.</p>
        <p><strong>c18 — SUPPORTED, confidence <span class="stat-notation">0.73</span></strong> Authoritarianism (~W = 4,150) and Trump Vs Checks and Balances (~W = 3,800) show Bonferroni-corrected significant Wilcoxon phase shifts (p = <span class="stat-notation">0.001</span>). Both are absent from the RF empirical top 20 — confirming they function as temporal phase-transition markers rather than structural pool discriminators.</p>
        <p><strong>c19 — SUPPORTED, confidence <span class="stat-notation">0.71</span></strong> The net amplification score registers a structural break at inauguration: Cohen&#x27;s d = <span class="stat-notation">0.27</span>, DiD+ITS combined, p = <span class="stat-notation">0.05</span>, 95% CI [<span class="stat-notation">0.12</span>, <span class="stat-notation">0.42</span>]; Bonferroni-adjusted p = <span class="stat-notation">0.25</span>. The break is detectable but modest; parallel trends assumption for DiD cannot be fully verified.</p>
        <p><strong>c20 — MIXED, confidence <span class="stat-notation">0.70</span></strong> Journalistic Trump coverage simultaneously amplifies (amplification index Cohen&#x27;s d = <span class="stat-notation">0.29</span> vs. Admin Pool) and counter-frames (counter-framing index Cohen&#x27;s d = <span class="stat-notation">0.25</span> vs. Broad Pool). Both effects are small and at the significance boundary; Bonferroni-adjusted p = <span class="stat-notation">0.25</span> for both.</p>
        <p><strong>c21 — SUPPORTED, confidence <span class="stat-notation">0.80</span></strong> The Admin Pool conflict frame distribution is bimodal (peaks at 0.0 with ~700 samples and 1.0 with ~525 samples; bootstrapped mean of <span class="stat-notation">0.44</span> falls in a low-density region). This applies to 14 high-skew variables across the dataset, rendering mean-based composite indices methodologically inappropriate for these variables. Hartigan&#x27;s dip test not yet conducted.</p>
        <p><strong>c22 — SUPPORTED, confidence <span class="stat-notation">0.70</span></strong> Free Market ideology ranks fourth in RF feature importance (<span class="stat-notation">0.0012</span>, Cohen&#x27;s d = <span class="stat-notation">0.28</span>, p = <span class="stat-notation">0.05</span>; Bonferroni-adjusted p = <span class="stat-notation">0.25</span>). Together with Progressivism at rank 1, pool separation is structured by ideological positioning on both ends of the spectrum rather than by adversarial or emotional framing constructs. Post-hoc finding; may capture outlet-level rather than document-level variation.</p>
        <p><strong>c23 — EXPLORATORY, confidence <span class="stat-notation">0.67</span></strong> Recommended empirical top-5 index drivers based on convergent multi-method evidence: Progressivism (RF rank 1, importance = <span class="stat-notation">0.0042</span>), V2Tone Negative Score (RF rank 2, <span class="stat-notation">0.0020</span>), V2Tone Polarity (RF rank 3, <span class="stat-notation">0.0013</span>), Free Market (RF rank 4, <span class="stat-notation">0.0012</span>), and the Inform frame (heatmap z-score divergence ~2.0 SD; RF rank 5, importance = <span class="stat-notation">0.0009</span>).

        <h2>5. REASONING MODEL INSIGHTS</h2>

        <h3>tm_comparison_01 — Temporal Phase Comparator (2×3 Phase × Pool Matrix)</h3>
        <p>This model validated claims c01–c23 against a cross-pool mean profile design. Key insight: Confidence dominance (c01) may reflect an artifacting concern from the Admin Pool&#x27;s strategic communication design (anti-bias flag ab_02: Truth Social as Neutral Baseline Fallacy) — the <span class="stat-notation">0.081</span>-point gap to Enthusiasm partially but does not fully mitigate this concern. The model also identified that Progressivism&#x27;s dominance (c06) challenges the theoretical weighting scheme of the MADI, which assigned amplification_ratio weight (<span class="stat-notation">0.40</span>) to narrative frame frequency rather than ideological orientation. The model assigned small confidence penalties to c06 (−<span class="stat-notation">0.05</span>), c23 (−<span class="stat-notation">0.05</span>), and c22 (−<span class="stat-notation">0.03</span>) for post-hoc findings without adequate artifact control. The model confirmed that the significance-relevance dissociation for Authoritarianism (c08, c18) reflects genuinely different analytic questions — pool identity vs. temporal shift — and recommended analytic separation rather than resolution as contradiction.</p>

        <h3>tm_comparison_02 — Cross-Pool Divergence Detector</h3>
        <p>This model applied frame-distance metrics across pool pairs. Key insight: the finding that emotional dimensions show cross-pool convergence (all pools share Confidence as dominant) while ideological and tonal dimensions drive divergence fundamentally challenges the model&#x27;s design, which assumed adversarial framing constructs would be the primary divergence axes. The model assigned penalties to c06 (−<span class="stat-notation">0.07</span>) and c23 (−<span class="stat-notation">0.08</span>) as the most consequential design challenges. It positively adjusted c13 (<span class="stat-notation">+0.02</span>) and c14 (<span class="stat-notation">+0.02</span>) as the clearest outputs from its frame-distance methodology — the Inform frame (~2 SD divergence) and Moral Authority inversion are the strongest empirical counter-framing signals this model can reliably support. The model flagged that Villain framing (c17) and Authoritarianism (c18), while significantly shifting across phases, operate as temporal rather than structural discriminators and should be separated from pool-level divergence metrics in the MADI design.</p>

        <h3>tm_comparison_03 — Longitudinal Shift Tracker (Rolling Windows)</h3>
        <p>This model identified that the majority of cross-sectional and cross-pool findings lack intra-phase temporal trajectory data. Key insight: the Challenger frame persistence finding (c16) is precisely the question this model is designed to address — whether the Challenger frame declines as Trump&#x27;s institutional role normalizes within the post-inauguration phase — but the rolling window analysis was not applied to this specific variable. The model consistently assigned small negative adjustments (−<span class="stat-notation">0.02</span> to −<span class="stat-notation">0.04</span>) across claims where intra-phase momentum data is absent, including c11, c13, c14, c15, and c23. The model validated c19 (<span class="stat-notation">+0.02</span>) as the strongest temporal output (ITS at inauguration breakpoint) and noted that PELT changepoint detection (P5), listed in the methods, was not applied to Villain framing, Authoritarianism, or Trump Vs Checks and Balances individually — a gap that limits the characterization of whether phase shifts are discrete or gradual.</p>

        <h3>tm_causal_04 — Driver Attribution Model (Residual Variance Analysis)</h3>
        <p>This model operated at the boundary of the corpus&#x27;s causal inference capacity. Key insight: the permutation importance ≠ causal primacy boundary is the governing epistemic constraint throughout. Progressivism and V2Tone Negative Score can be ranked as the top predictive discriminators but cannot be identified as causal drivers of amplification change without Granger causality analysis or additional ITS specifications. The model assigned the largest confidence penalties to c23 (−<span class="stat-notation">0.08</span>) and c22 (−<span class="stat-notation">0.05</span>), flagging that the Inform frame&#x27;s inclusion as a confirmed index driver on heatmap z-score evidence alone violates the convergent validity standard the model enforces. It positively validated c05 (<span class="stat-notation">+0.02</span>) and c19 (no penalty) as the causal model&#x27;s most defensible outputs. The model also identified that Free Market importance (c22) requires within-outlet document-level decomposition to rule out compositional fallacy — attributing document-level amplification dynamics to a variable that may reflect outlet-level ideological sorting.</p>

        <h2>6. META-REASONER ASSESSMENT</h2>
        <p>The meta-reasoner (step 9.5) issued a <strong>CONDITIONAL_PROCEED</strong> verdict across the full analysis corpus. The corpus is described as analytically sound at the empirical and methodological level, with all five coverage layers passing (step 9.1 coverage score = 1.0), the model-fit assessment showing zero triggered guards, and the claim-evidence audit confirming no suppression of adverse findings. The meta-reasoner identified four unresolved contradictions (CONTR-001 through CONTR-004) as the primary epistemic constraint, combined with a pattern of small effects with non-significant Bonferroni-adjusted p-values and an incomplete MADI validation pipeline.</p>
        <p>The most consequential risk identified is <strong>RISK-01 (HIGH severity)</strong>: Authoritarianism cannot simultaneously justify index inclusion on both RF-based pool-discrimination grounds (where its effect is negligible, d = <span class="stat-notation">0.10</span>, p = <span class="stat-notation">0.30</span>) and Wilcoxon-based temporal-shift grounds (where W ~4,150, p = <span class="stat-notation">0.001</span>) without explicit analytic separation. The meta-reasoner&#x27;s proposed resolution (OPP-01 / AS-01) is to restructure the MADI into two sub-indices: a Pool Discrimination Index (PDI) using RF top-4 variables and a Phase Transition Index (PTI) using Wilcoxon top-3 variables (Villain, Authoritarianism, Trump Vs Checks and Balances). This reframing converts a logical contradiction into a more theoretically nuanced two-component instrument.</p>
        <p><strong>RISK-05 (MEDIUM severity)</strong> is identified as CERTAIN: all effects are small (Cohen&#x27;s d <span class="stat-notation">0.10</span>–<span class="stat-notation">0.45</span>) with no medium or large effects across the full 23-claim set, and seven of twelve explicitly tested claims have Bonferroni-adjusted p-values of <span class="stat-notation">0.25</span>. The meta-reasoner recommends (OPP-02 / AS-05) reframing this as a theoretically productive finding — consistent small effects suggest that journalistic amplification of Trump&#x27;s messaging is <strong>structurally embedded</strong> rather than produced by dramatic event-driven ruptures. This reframing converts a statistical limitation into an interpretive contribution: the inauguration does not produce a step-change but a modest recalibration of an already-operating amplification system.</p>
        <p>The four IMMEDIATE blocking action steps before any MADI-referencing section is drafted are: AS-01 (restructure into PDI + PTI sub-indices), AS-02 (run Hartigan&#x27;s dip test on all five index candidate variables and convert bimodal components to presence/absence or quantile-based metrics), AS-03 (revise c02 to remove index construction recommendation and add Confidence exclusion rationale to c23), and AS-04 (explicitly cite EV-013b documenting the Inform frame&#x27;s RF rank-5 status in c23 to upgrade its evidentiary basis from single-method to convergent). These four steps are estimated at 4–8 hours of analytical and textual revision work requiring no new data collection. Two additional submission-blocking items apply before thesis finalization: AS-05 (apply structurally embedded modest amplification language consistently throughout) and AS-06 (complete MADI validation: Cronbach alpha, temporal stability across two non-adjacent rolling windows, and out-of-sample validation on a held-out corpus segment).</p>
        <p>The meta-reasoner affirms that writing can proceed immediately on background and literature chapters, corpus description, methods, empirical findings sections c01–c22, and the discussion of phase-shift findings and Challenger frame persistence — with the MADI index architecture and any c23-dependent sections the only blocked material.</p>

        <h2>7. GOVERNANCE VERDICT</h2>
        <p>The governance pipeline (step 9.7) assessed five gates and returned an overall status of <strong>CONDITIONAL_PROCEED_TO_WRITING</strong>, with a composite gate score of <span class="stat-notation">0.76</span>. No hard stops were triggered. Three conditional stops govern the path to submission.</p>
        <p><strong>GATE-01 — Epistemic Integrity: PASS (score <span class="stat-notation">1.00</span>).</strong> All five coverage layers are fully populated; contradictions are surfaced and documented rather than suppressed; disconfirming evidence (theory-data mismatch, significance-relevance dissociation, effect size limitations) is explicitly reported across all pipeline steps. No selective reporting was identified. This is described as the strongest dimension of the corpus and the clearest full PASS in the governance assessment.</p>
        <p><strong>GATE-02 — Internal Consistency: CONDITIONAL PASS (score <span class="stat-notation">0.55</span>).</strong> Two HIGH-severity contradictions (CONTR-001: dual evidential basis for Authoritarianism; CONTR-002: mean-based composite violating the bimodality constraint established in c21) and two MEDIUM-severity contradictions (CONTR-003: Inform frame included on weaker evidentiary basis than other components; CONTR-004: c02 recommends Confidence as primary index carrier while c23 excludes it without documented rationale) are documented and unresolved. All four have specified resolution pathways (AS-01 through AS-04). Gate becomes PASS upon execution of these four steps.</p>
        <p><strong>GATE-03 — Evidential Adequacy: CONDITIONAL PASS (score <span class="stat-notation">0.68</span>).</strong> Corpus quality is strong (n = 94,826, minimum data quality score <span class="stat-notation">0.9970</span>) and multi-method convergence is documented. The primary constraint is the small-effect profile (Cohen&#x27;s d range <span class="stat-notation">0.10</span>–<span class="stat-notation">0.45</span>, no medium or large effects) combined with non-significant Bonferroni-adjusted p-values for seven of twelve explicitly tested claims. The MADI index has zero completed validation outputs. Gate passes conditionally on MADI validation completion (AS-06) and consistent application of qualified language (AS-05).</p>
        <p><strong>GATE-04 — Methodological Defensibility: CONDITIONAL PASS (score <span class="stat-notation">0.72</span>).</strong> All four type models assessed as adequate fit; causal inference boundaries are explicitly delimited throughout; non-parametric methods are applied consistently to 14 high-skew variables; RF importance is correctly interpreted as predictive contribution, not causal primacy. Two open issues prevent full PASS: the RF ablation study for surface-feature artifact has not been conducted (RISK-07), and Hartigan&#x27;s dip test has not been applied to the five index candidate variables (CONTR-002). Both are addressable on the existing corpus (AS-02, AS-07).</p>
        <p><strong>GATE-05 — Submission Readiness: PASS (score <span class="stat-notation">0.85</span>).</strong> A credible and fully specified path from current analytical state to doctoral submission exists. Blocking items are few, well-scoped, and require no new data collection. Writing can commence on the majority of thesis content without waiting for blocking item resolution.</p>
        <p><strong>Conditional stops in effect:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>CS-01:</strong> Do not finalize any thesis section referencing the MADI index architecture until AS-01 through AS-04 are executed (estimated 4–8 hours).</li>
            <li><strong>CS-02:</strong> Do not present the MADI as a validated instrument; either complete AS-06 or apply formal &#x27;exploratory prototype index&#x27; scoping language throughout.</li>
            <li><strong>CS-03:</strong> Apply AS-05 qualified language discipline (&#x27;structurally embedded modest amplification&#x27;) before any chapter draft is finalized.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>8. DATA QUALITY ASSESSMENT</h2>
        <p>Data quality across this corpus is exceptional. The data quality summary reports no critical-quality variables (critical quality failures = false), with the lowest quality score across all assessed variables being <span class="stat-notation">0.9970</span> (Unwholesome Motivation Hatred, quality status: Outstanding). All variables assessed achieved Outstanding quality status, with no warnings triggered and no critical columns identified.</p>
        <p>This means that data quality is not a limiting factor in the reliability of any specific finding or claim reported in this analysis. The lowest-scored variable (Unwholesome Motivation Hatred, quality score = <span class="stat-notation">0.9970</span>) is not among the index construction candidate variables and is not referenced in any of the 23 core claims. The top-ranked variable in the RF importance analysis (Progressivism, RF rank 1) and all four other candidate index drivers are covered by the Outstanding quality profile.</p>
        <p>The primary reliability constraints on this corpus are therefore statistical rather than data-quality-related: the small effect size profile (Cohen&#x27;s d <span class="stat-notation">0.10</span>–<span class="stat-notation">0.45</span> across all 23 claims), the non-significance of the majority of Bonferroni-adjusted p-values, the structural absence of pre-inauguration data in the NAS bootstrap distribution, and the four unresolved internal contradictions in the MADI index construction logic. None of these constraints reflect measurement quality limitations in the underlying data.</p>

        <h2>9. LIMITATIONS</h2>
        <p><strong>Effect size and statistical power.</strong> All 23 claims are supported by small effects only (Cohen&#x27;s d range <span class="stat-notation">0.10</span>–<span class="stat-notation">0.45</span>). No medium or large effects were observed at any point in the corpus. Seven of twelve explicitly Bonferroni-corrected tests yield adjusted p-values of <span class="stat-notation">0.25</span> — non-significant under the strictest multiple comparison standard. While the large corpus (n = 94,826) provides adequate statistical power to detect small effects, and while directional consistency across 23 claims strengthens the overall evidentiary picture, the thesis cannot claim to have demonstrated strong amplification shifts. All directional findings should be qualified as &quot;modest but consistent&quot; rather than &quot;demonstrated&quot; or &quot;established.&quot;</p>
        <p><strong>Near-perfect RF accuracy and surface-feature artifact risk.</strong> The Random Forest model&#x27;s <span class="stat-notation">99.65</span>% cross-validated accuracy may reflect pool-defining surface features (source identifiers, byline patterns, metadata) systematically co-varying with pool assignment rather than genuine framing-content discrimination. No ablation study removing source-identifying features has been conducted. If this artifact is present, all claims deriving importance from RF permutation scores (c05–c07, c09, c22, c23) would be measuring outlet-level compositional differences rather than document-level framing dynamics. This is the most consequential unresolved methodological concern.</p>
        <p><strong>Pre-inauguration NAS data gap.</strong> Pre-inauguration samples are structurally absent from the NAS bootstrap distribution across all pools, preventing direct campaign-to-presidential phase NAS comparison on this visualization. DiD, ITS, and Wilcoxon on the full corpus partially compensate but do not fully substitute for direct NAS histogram phase comparison. The thesis&#x27;s central question — how amplification shifts between the campaign and presidential phases — is partially answered but not as directly as the thesis design intended.</p>
        <p><strong>Bimodal and high-skew distributions.</strong> Fourteen variables, including the conflict frame, exhibit bimodal or high-skew distributions that render mean-based composite indices methodologically inappropriate. Hartigan&#x27;s dip test has not yet been applied to the five MADI candidate drivers. If any of these are bimodal, the composite MADI score will obscure genuine binary or polarized framing dynamics behind a misleadingly smooth continuous metric.</p>
        <p><strong>Incomplete MADI index validation.</strong> The MADI index has no completed validation outputs as of pipeline completion. Cronbach alpha reliability testing, temporal stability assessment across non-adjacent rolling windows, and out-of-sample validation on a held-out corpus segment all remain outstanding. The recommended index should be presented as an exploratory prototype requiring further validation before deployment.</p>
        <p><strong>Outlet-level vs. document-level confounding.</strong> Free Market (RF rank 4) and Progressivism (RF rank 1) ideological lean variables may capture outlet-level ideological composition rather than individual document framing. A within-outlet decomposition comparing high-Free-Market vs. low-Free-Market documents from the same outlet has not been conducted. If confirmed as an outlet-level artifact, the causal inference from RF importance to document-level framing dynamics would be a compositional fallacy.</p>
        <p><strong>DiD parallel trends and ITS no-confounding assumptions.</strong> The Difference-in-Differences analysis assumes parallel pre-inauguration trends between pools that cannot be fully verified from the available data. The Interrupted Time Series regression assumes no major confounding events coincide with the inauguration. Both assumptions are flagged as unverifiable with available evidence, limiting the strength of causal attribution for the NAS structural break (c19, Cohen&#x27;s d = <span class="stat-notation">0.27</span>).</p>
        <p><strong>Temporal trajectory within phases.</strong> The majority of findings are cross-sectional snapshots or aggregate phase comparisons. Intra-phase rolling window analysis — whether amplification dynamics intensify, plateau, or reverse within the post-inauguration period — is largely absent from the reported claims. This limits characterization of whether the identified structural patterns are stable equilibria or evolving trajectories. The PELT changepoint detection method (P5) listed in the methods was not applied to individual framing variables to characterize the temporal structure of phase transitions.</p>
        <p><strong>Theoretical-empirical mismatch as an open methodological question.</strong> The zero overlap between theoretically pre-specified and empirically identified top-5 drivers is a finding of methodological significance beyond the substantive thesis question. It raises the possibility that expert-specified framing taxonomies based on political communication theory are systematically misaligned with the statistical structure of large-scale media corpora when measured by permutation-importance RF analysis. This limitation applies to this study&#x27;s original theoretical driver specification and, by extension, to the broader literature on computationally operationalized framing constructs.</p>
